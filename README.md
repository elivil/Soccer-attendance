This project analyzes attendance at soccer games. Top 3 teams in 5 European leagues (England, Spain, Italy, Germany and France) are 
selected for analysis. The attendance at their competitive games in 2017/18 season is collated in "att.csv". The stadium capacities 
are in "stad.csv". The Jupyter notebook analyzes attendance based on a number of factors.
